# Introduction #

Hey dudes, quite a while since the last update. But that doesn't mean development has stopped.

This code is made for an MSP430, but in reality I wish to make it portable to the AVR ATMEGA MCUs. This is mainly since the AVR is more friendly to hobbyists due to the PDIP package.

SysEx and SysEx -> CSV parser have been written and has been sucessfully implemented. I'm still to implement a propper CC04 (Foot Pedal) part of things. But it is still to come!

Please join and register your interest in this project. This project is fully open source as well as schematics. Obviously you may design your own hardware and change parts of the code to suit as well!
