# Introduction #

Notes / channel codes can be dynamically changed depending on the state of another input.


# Details #

Both Analogue and Digital Type triggers can have dual triggers. Obviously it doesn't make too much sense to have one trigger it's own dual trigger... but it does add a bit of dynamicness to the midi output.

Ie. for a hi-hat it can output a different note depending on the state of say a digital input foot switch or an analogue footswitch.
